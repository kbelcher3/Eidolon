# From 177 to 6x3 - Duo Volt Eidolon Hunting Complete Guide 


## What is an Eidolon? Am I ready for this? Why do I want this?

*Eidolons are simple-minded, spectral fragments of the shattered Sentient that roam the Plains of Eidolon at night.*

More seriously, Eidolons are arguably the most mechanically complex content in Warframe and there is a sizable community of "hunters" who regularly go out onto the Plains at night to capture them. Aside from being the best Focus farm in the game (a tricap gives 177,500 Focus which doesn't count towards the daily cap) and an easy source of Quills reputation from Sentient Cores, they drop many sought-after arcanes such as Arcane Energize and Arcane Grace. 

Since the Focus rework in Update 31 (Angels of the Zariman) and in particular Update 31.5 (Echoes of the Zariman), Eidolon hunts have become more accessible than ever. With the proper gear, it is mostly a matter of learning and practise until one can confidently capture six Hydrolysts in the 50-minute night cycle. For some technical reasons it is easiest to do this in a two-person squad ("duo"), and so that is what I will be focusing on.

Before reading further, I would advise you to take a look at https://tinyurl.com/eidolonwiki - there is a lot of great information there, written by hunters far more knowledgeable and skilled than I, along with an invite to the most active and helpful English-speaking Discord server for Eidolon hunting. The purpose of these notes/videos is to help newer hunters bridge the gap between the "Beginner"   and "Advanced" guides in the Eidolon Wiki.
